<p>Hi there, I am Steve George Odette, But George is just fine. I am a computational biologist interested in working on molecular biology, immunology, and epigenetics problems. I have diverse expertise, combining wet lab and dry lab skills. My For wet lab, I am proficient at s. For dry lab/computational biology, I have an extensive experience with next generation sequencing data analysis and pipeline/workflow development 🔬.</p>

<h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developed a highly efficient Nextflow pipeline</strong> for the analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole-genome sequencing data, streamlining the process and enabling rapid insights. (<a href="https://github.com/GeOdette/mtbcore" target="_blank">Project Link</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Conducted comprehensive RNAseq analysis</strong> for cutaneous leishmaniasis, uncovering novel insights into the disease's molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. (<a href="https://github.com/GeOdette/RNAseq" target="_blank">Project Link</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Contributed to the development of vaccine candidates</strong> for East Coast Fever and peste des petits ruminants virus through rigorous research and data analysis during my veterinary internship 🧪.</li>
